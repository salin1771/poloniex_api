## Poloniex_api
python project which looks for crypto arbitrage opportunities by using the poloniex api 

## Triangular Arbitrage in Cryptocurrency
This project focuses on identifying and exploiting triangular arbitrage opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. The project is developed using Python and JavaScript, and it covers both centralized exchanges (CeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DeFi).

## Project Overview
This project aims to:

Gain a deep understanding of arbitrage with a particular focus on triangular arbitrage.
Develop skills in Python and JavaScript for implementing arbitrage strategies.
Establish all traceable triangular arbitrage pairs.
Calculate surface rate opportunities across all pairs.
Calculate real rates for arbitrage with depth.
Cover the above points in both CeFi (with the Poloniex exchange) and DeFi (with Uniswap V3).
Pull data from the web by exploring the REST API endpoints with Poloniex.
Read blockchain price information with Web3 and Ethers.js.
Work with the Uniswap V3 SDK.

## Features


Triangular Arbitrage Calculation: Identify and calculate triangular arbitrage opportunities.
Surface Rate Calculation: Calculate surface rate opportunities across all pairs.
Real Rate Calculation: Calculate real rates for arbitrage with depth.
Data Retrieval: Pull data from Poloniex and other exchanges using REST APIs.
Blockchain Interaction: Read blockchain price information using Web3 and Ethers.js.
Uniswap V3 SDK: Work with the Uniswap V3 SDK for DeFi arbitrage.

## Technologies Used


Python: For implementing the core logic and calculations.
JavaScript: For additional functionalities and comparisons.
Poloniex API: For retrieving data from the Poloniex exchange.
Web3 and Ethers.js: For interacting with the blockchain.
Uniswap V3 SDK: For working with Uniswap V3.

## Getting Started


## Prerequisites


Basic knowledge of cryptocurrencies.
No prior programming skills or knowledge of arbitrage needed.

## Installation


## 1.Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/salin1771/poloniex_api.git
```

## 2. move into the repo

```shell   
cd poloniex_api
```

## 3.Install the required JavaScript packages:

```shell
npm install
```

## Usage


1.Run the Python scripts to calculate triangular arbitrage opportunities:
python func_arbitrage.py

2.Use the JavaScript files for additional functionalities and comparisons.
the javascript file contains all the possible pair cycles for the triangular arbitrage.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed to explore and implement triangular arbitrage strategies in the cryptocurrency market. It covers both centralized and decentralized exchanges, providing a comprehensive understanding of arbitrage opportunities.
